# Random Coding Problems
Repo consists of programs solving problem statements. Something I do in my get free time. This file holds questions with corresponding file names and time complexity. Would like to hear a feedback from anyone reading this. Cheers :)

Questions asked by Daily coding problems.


| Problem Statements | File |Time Complexity | Implementation (MVP)| Also asked by|
|----------|:----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|1. Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed). For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true. Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false. |BracketBalance.java|O(n)| Stacks & ArrayLists| Facebook|
|2. Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A". Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.|RLE.java| **Encoding**- O(n) **Decoding**- O(mn) |Regular Expression| Amazon |
|3. Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element. Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers. For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out: 2 1.5 2 3.5 2 2 2|MedianCalculator.java| O(n)|ArrayLists saving time by sorting itself| Microsoft |
